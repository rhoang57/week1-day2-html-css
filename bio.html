    <p>I am the youngest of 7 children. I was the only child born in the United States. Unfortunately, I was born in <em>Nebraska</em>! I then moved to Philly and Atlanta. Atlanta is the city I call home because I lived most of my life there and went to school there. I am now a teacher, graphic illustrator, children's book author, and web designer. I have been married for six and a half years and have a 16 month old daughter named Dylan Rose.  </p>
